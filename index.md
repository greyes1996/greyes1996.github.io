I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM! I am currently at Stanford University as a first-year PhD student in their [Developmental and Psychological Sciences program](https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral/daps) on a [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship](https://kh.stanford.edu). You can view my most current CV [**HERE.**]({{ site.url }}/assets/GabrielReyes_CV.pdf)

In addition to pursuing my Ph.D., I am the founder and Executive Director of [FLi Sci](https://www.FLiSci.org), a nonprofit organization supporting first-gen/low-income (FLi) students to pursue careers in science and medicine. Recently, I was awarded a 2023 [Echoing Green Fellowship](https://fellows.echoinggreen.org/fellow/gabriel-reyes/) and an investment from [NewSchools Venture Fund's Racial Equity portfolio.](https://www.newschools.org/venture/fli-sci/)
