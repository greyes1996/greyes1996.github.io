I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM! I am currently at Stanford University as a first-year PhD student in their [Developmental and Psychological Sciences program](https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral/daps) on a [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship](https://kh.stanford.edu). You can view my most current CV [**HERE.**]({{ site.url }}/assets/GabrielReyes_CV.pdf)

Previously, I graduated from Brown University with an [Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Leslie Welch](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/leslie-welch) and [Dr. Monica Linden](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ml32).
