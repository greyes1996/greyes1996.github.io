## FLi Sci Scholars Program

Through support of a New Normal Fellowship, every Sunday, I meet with 8 FLi Sci Scholars to review topics promoting academic and personal skillsets to promote more engagement and retention in the sciences. For more details, visit [www.flisci.com](https://www.flisci.com) 

## **Data, Activated!** 

During the summer of 2020, I was a Data, Activated! TA (DATA) where I directly mentored 8 students in the [Opportunity Network Fellowship](https://opportunitynetwork.org/fellows/) program. 

# Brown University

## **The Neuroscience of Racism** 

In the final semester of my undergraduate years, Monica Linden and I created a course at Brown to investigate the neural correlates of racial bias using literature from cognitive, affective, and developmpental neuroscience. 

We taught a total of 7 students with all class years represented. Materials from the course will be posted shortly. 

##  Undergraduate Teaching Assistant 
I was an academic assistant for the following courses:
* NEUR 2600: Advanced Systems Neuroscience II - this was a graduate-level statistics course for students at Brown's Neuroscience PhD program. I supported David Sheinberg and Monica Linden (Spring 2018)
* CLPS 0900: Quantitative Methods in Psychology - this was an introductory statistics course for undergraduates in the Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences (CLPS) department at Brown. I supported Kathryn Spoehr in a flipped classroom course.(Fall 2017) 
* CLPS 0400: Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience - an introductory course for undergraduates at Brown where I supported Dima Amso. (Spring 2017)
