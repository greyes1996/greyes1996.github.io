titie: Tracking my PhD Progress
---

*This is a draft page! Content here is a work-in-progress and will be changing drastically over the next few weeks*

I will be tracking my PhD progress both for myself but also for other students who intend to pursue a doctorate at the Graduate School of Education at Stanford. As such, this page will be updated frequently to track this progress rather than post a new update. I also hope that this transparency is useful for people who are applying and want to know what life as a PhD student in the GSE is like. 

My program requires enrollment in our doctoral core each quarter (Proseminar I, II, and III) as well as a methodology core of our choosing. And to specialize in the Developmental and Psychological Sciences (DAPS) track, I need to take 4 courses. And then complete up to 135 units of additional coursework (which includes research coursework).

# Research Goals + Projects

[^1]: Stanford allows students that posses a Masters degree to transfer credits to satisfy up to 45 units of the required 135 units for our Ph.D. So I will be transferring as many of my coursework as I possibly can to my degree. 

[^2]: The total number of units may seem frightening / like a ton of coursework — but I think it depends on your circumstances. Since I am not pursuing a Masters or a PhD minor from Stanford, my primary requirements are listed above, and I intend to do more research than classes. However, even if I were not doing a Master’s, I think I would still do what is listed above and research the rest of the time.
