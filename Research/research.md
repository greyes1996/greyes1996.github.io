# Research at Stanford University
I am a PhD student in the [Developmental and Psychological Sciences Program](https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral-handbook/courses/daps). My research interest focuses on the psychological and neurological imapcts of poverty on development and its implications for soceity.

# Research at Columbia University
### *My Masters Thesis*
For my graduate program at Columbia, my thesis is exploring learning and memory and the role financial stress affects cognition associated with learning and memory. You can access a copy of my thesis [here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/reyes_columbia_thesis.pdf)

While at Teachers College, I presented my thesis research at two conferences: the [2020 Academic Festival](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2020/november/exploring-povertys-impact-on-learning/) and at the 4th annual [Institute for Psychological Sciences and Practice (IPSP)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHcQMoCvLhg8NDu5u6FHP5sTvxMrIeN_/view?usp=sharing). 

# Research at Brown University 
### *My Undergraduate Honors Thesis*
Working with Dr. Leslie Welch, we explored a rare phenomenon known as Aphantasia - the inabiltiy to conjure up images in the mind's eye. We conducted a remote study where participants with and without aphantasia engaged in a mental rotation task. 

### *The Neuroscience of Racism*
Along with 7 other students at Brown, I co-created a research seminar at Brown under the mentorship of [Dr. Monica Linden.](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ml32)

Additionally, for our final presentation, I organized a public presentation inviting the Brown community as well as the general public to attend a talk of our primary findings. A copy of our slides from that presentation can be found [here](). I also presented at Brown's [Theories in Action](http://www.browntia.org/past-years) conference on a roundtable discussion entitled "Applying Scientific Research." 

### *Race and Gender in the Scientific Community*
The first statistical project I engaged in was examining the antecedents that supported scientist from underrepresented backgrounds to acquire  positions as academic faculty. I was able ot present my findings from this project at the Humans in STEM conference at Yale University in 2018. 

And! Fun fact! I (unexpectedly!) ran into my BEST FRIEND from high school (she went to Amherst College for her undergrad) who was also invited to present at this conference.
